# Serenity
Serenity is a ROBLOX exploit that I made about 3 years ago in C++ . It uses the Lua C API for a newer and faster method of command execution and other internals. Serenity also has a context level of 6. This source is kind of outdated, though (I haven't touched it in about a year or so). I've decided to release it anyways because I quit ROBLOX and because of other reasons.

The release of Serenity is intended to (hopefully) be a learning base for someone creating their own exploit.
